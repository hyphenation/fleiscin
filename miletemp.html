<h1>Irish Hyphenation:<br>
Top 1000 Words</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The list below was created by finding the most common 1000
words in a large corpus of Irish texts (excluding, for simplicity,
words already containing hyphens or apostrophes).   All uppercase
letters were made lowercase.
Hyphens have been inserted according to the rules contained in the 
latest release.
</p>

<p>
Of course many of the highest frequency words
are short function words which do not admit hyphenations.  Note however
that the absence of "bad" hyphens is just as important as
complete coverage of "good" hyphens; please keep this in mind while
scanning the list for errors.    If you'd like a deeper list,
just ask; I can hyphenate as many as you want of the 300,000+ words in my
Irish <a href="../ispell/index.html">spellchecking database</a>.
