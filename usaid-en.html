<h2>Downloads</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you are using a TeX distribution like
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a>,
the Irish hyphenation patterns are installed by default
and chances are you don't need to download anything special from this site.
On my (Debian-based) Linux system, it was enough to
install the package <code>texlive-base</code>.</li>
<li>If for some reason you need to download the TeX patterns file
<code>hyph-ga.tex</code> directly, you can find it on
<a target="_blank" href="http://mirrors.rit.edu/CTAN/language/hyph-utf8/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/patterns/tex/">CTAN</a>, or the latest version
is always available from our
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hyphenation/fleiscin/releases">GitHub repository</a>.</li>
<li>Older versions of TeX and programs like GNU troff use an ASCII-only
version of the hyphenation patterns named <code>gahyph.tex</code>.
This file is also available from
<a target="_blank" href="https://ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hyphenation/">CTAN</a>, or from our
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hyphenation/fleiscin/releases">GitHub repository</a>.</li>
<li>The patterns can be used with OpenOffice.org by installing 
<a target="_blank" href="https://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/irish-language-spell-checker-thesaurus-and-hyphenation-patterns">this extension</a>.</li>
<li>The corresponding extension for LibreOffice can be downloaded
from the <a target="_blank" href="https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/irish-language-spell-checker-thesaurus-and-hyphenation-patterns">LibreOffice extension site</a>.</li>
<li>The file <code>hyph_ga_IE.zip</code> (for use with Scribus, or with
LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org if you'd rather not install the above extensions) can be
downloaded from an <a target="_blank" href="http://download.services.openoffice.org/contrib/dictionaries/hyph_ga_IE.zip.mirrorlist">OpenOffice.org mirror</a> or from 
our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hyphenation/fleiscin/releases">GitHub repository</a>.</li>
<li>The file <code>ga.xml</code> for Apache FOP or Folio can also be downloaded
from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hyphenation/fleiscin/releases">GitHub</a>.
<li>The patterns are integrated directly into the
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenator">Hyphenator.js</a> source code,
which comes with good documentation.</li>

<h2>LaTeX Usage</h2>
<p>
To typeset an Irish document in LaTeX, simply add the lines
<pre>
\usepackage[irish]{babel}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
</pre>
to the preamble and compile using LaTeX as usual.
This sets the default language of the document to Irish.
If you need to include some English passages, change the “babel”
line above to:
<pre>
\usepackage[english,irish]{babel}
</pre>
and use <code>\selectlanguage</code> in the body of the document as follows:
<pre>
\begin{document}
Tá sé thar a bheith éasca fleiscíní
a chur san áireamh anois.

\selectlanguage{english}
We don't talk no foreign talk
round these here parts.

\selectlanguage{irish}
Bainfidh mé úsáid as an acmhainn iontach seo.
\end{document}
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Important Remarks</h2>
<ul>
<li>TeX inserts a discretionary break after <em>explicit</em>
hyphens within words; this has the (mostly desirable) effect that
explicitly hyphenated words will only be broken at the hyphen.</li>
<li>This is fine for <i lang="ga">Breac-Ghaeltacht</i> or
<i lang="ga">Ard-Aighne</i>, 
but not for <i lang="ga">t-idirnáisiúnachas</i>. You will have to add your
own discretionary hyphens if such a word needs to be broken, e.g.
<code>t-idir\-náisiún\-achas</code>.</li>
<li>Conversely, you may want to <em>prevent</em> breaks at 
“t-” or “n-”; for this you can enclose the word in an <code>\mbox</code>.</li>
<li>Similar remarks hold for words containing apostrophes.</li>
<li>Since
<i lang="ga">amh-ras</i> is a legal hyphenation, it follows
that <i lang="ga">drochamh-ras</i> should be also, though naturally one would
much prefer <i lang="ga">droch-amhras</i>.
Unfortunately TeX has no mechanism for assigning “weights” to different
hyphen points in the same word, so you will have to beware of such
examples on your own.
