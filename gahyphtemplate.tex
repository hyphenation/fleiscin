%    I know of no written standards for hyphenation of Irish;
%    the patterns below were bootstrapped from an initial
%    database of hyphenated words extracted from actual
%    printed material.   This database was augmented through
%    the use of some "sed" scripts which added hyphens in obvious 
%    places: after standard prefixes, before morphological features
%    (verb endings, plural endings, etc.), and inside compound words.
%    I then performed a series of bootstrap steps using Patgen
%    and further refining with sed.
%  
%    The resulting hyphenation patterns are very much "etymological"
%    vs. "phonological".   As a consequence, they do not always
%    agree with hyphenations I've found in texts.  For instance:
%
%     These patterns             Corpus
%      "Ceilt-each"     vs.    "Ceil-teach"
%      "siosc-adh"      vs.    "sios-cadh" 
%      "craic-eann"     vs.    "crai-ceann"
%      "ceann-aithe"    vs.    "cean-naithe"
%      "tuairt-eáil"    vs.    "tuair-teáil"
%      "comh-alta"      vs.    "com-halta"
%
%    The last, of course, is an abomination of the worst kind.
%
%    Please report incorrect hyphenations to the author at the 
%    email address above.
